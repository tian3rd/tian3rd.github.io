## Volunteer Continues

Today, just as I was skimming the travel guides in the bookshop, I got an email from the uni saying there was a volunteering expo happening right now across the student center. So I walked there and chatted a little bit. I signed up for two organizations: [Orange Sky]() and [Food Co-op]().

Orange Sky offers free laundry services for friends on the street. They drive some vans to fixed locations scattered across Canberra suburbs. That's a sound idea to help and connect with the community.

Food Co-op doesn't have a website to sign up, so I write an email to get in touch with them. It is a small cafe offering affordable meals. I can help prepare the food, clean the jars or serve lunch. That's nice a way to meet people around. The location is unbeatable because it's around the corner of the campus.

The volunteer job appeals to me for some reasons. The first is that there's no pressure when you help people, and everyone can contribute to the same goal. The only expectation is the willingness to help. The second is that it's a great way to spend the free time or school time, while also getting to know the community around me. Compared with real work, school work only gets tense during the end of semester, and most of the time I'm the sole people responsible for my school work. So I get boring and lose directions often, leading to a waste of free time either by losing in video games or pointless social media. The volunteer work brings back the real connection with people and community, and it feels much better. The third reason is that as a foreigner, it's sometimes hard to feel the true society because people tend to hang out with others with similar culture background. Therefore, volunteering can serve as a window for me to see a this city with a different yet real angle.
