## Overall Structure

This semester I'll focus on the fundamentals, namely **Programming**, **Computer Architecture**, and **Algorithms and Data Structures**. Luckily, there are plenty of high-quality resources out there for me along the journey.

- [Structure and interpretation of Computer Programs](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1mq4y1f7te)
  - https://cs61a.org
- [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Rv411e7jE)
  - http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/labs.html
- [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Th411Y72K)
  - More [versions](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/lecture-videos/)

_For fun_:
