## Teaching Experience

As a matter of fact, I don't have experience in tutoring at ANU, so I'm new to tutoring at a university/college level. However, I do have experience in teaching and helping middle school and high school students. When I was a undergraduate student, I worked as a part-time tutor for a whole semester and summer holiday period when I taught a group of students the courses of chemistry, physics and maths. My major was condensed matter physics, but I enjoyed applying the theories from physics in other disciplines as well. Back then, the tutoring was aimed at achieving better grades for their monthly tests and exams. Therefore, I made a tailored plan by curating a list of typical problems for teaching. Starting from basic concepts, the teaching can transistion into more complex analysis once the students understood the fundamentals. Critical thinking is vital to problem solving, so I always challenged them to explore alternative solutions. On the other hand, practice is an indispensable part of learning, even though it was a slow and exhausting process sometimes. Above all, it shows that I am responsible and devoted to helping students learn and grow because I am a believer of lifelong learning.

## Vision for the Role of Tutor

- Sharing the knowledge
- Getting your hands dirty
- Consistency and responsibility
- Making suggestions for improvement

The most important role of a tutor is to share the knowledge with students rather than just show them the answers. In the process of sharing and communicating, the tutor can really understand where the confusion is, and then guide the students with some useful tips, and also encourage them to think critially by themselves. Sometimes the students couldn't get hold of certain concepts (this is certainly true when I got stuck in the labs), then the tutor can share his understanding of such subjects and providing some examples. I am fortunate to learn from many wonderful tutors from CECS as they are always patient in analysing the problems together with me, and sharing their point of view in the discussion. Special thanks to Ryan who shared with me how he tackled the problems and how things worked with many examples. 

Of course, the tutor should always get the hands dirty by experimenting with the course/lab materials beforehand. It shows that the tutor is passionate about learning and tutoring. By fully preparing the course/lab materials, the tutors can always deepen their own understandings of the subjects. For me, even though I'm not a tutor, if I find the course to be intriguing and challenging, I create a dedicated repository on my GitHub and keep updating it with new learning outcomes and fun challenges. (I maintain several of my favourite courses at ANU on GitHub actually.) On the other hand, it would also be less fun if tutors only stick to what's written in the powerpoints, and they would probably come across questions they haven't anticipated and prepared.  

For consistency and responsibility, the tutors should work as a team to gather ideas and deliver to the cohort of students. Although every tutor works alones and has different levels of experience, each one should make sure that what he/she teaches and conveys to the students is always consistent with the course materials by the course convener. This is also a responsible way for all members in the tutoring team.

Last but not least, in terms of marking, the purpose is not just grading the assignments, but also providing suggestions for the students to learn and improve. The grade is not an end, but a start for the students to reflect on the work, and keep on polishing up the skills. Therefore, the tutor should always have an unbiased and sincere attitude when engaging in the marking process. Also, the whole course and lab acitivites can benefit a lot from all these tutoring experience from different tutors.
