title: "Day 1 - 100 Days of X"
---

> So, I'm going to start with a 100 day challenge. Ok, let me watch a youtube video first to relax a little bit. Yeah, just kidding...

## Overview

Today's agenda is to review the section of hash table and binary search trees (week 6). The resources used are the videos and files on wattle. Should cover everything from the textbook CLRS. Also, since I'm committed to 100 days of coding and reading, try to write some code to implement some of the algorithms with test cases. Maybe start with python which is easier in the process.

The side project today is to start a project of Hearthstone battleground winrate prediction. [Hearthstone API](https://develop.battle.net/documentation/hearthstone/game-data-apis) is the next step for this.
