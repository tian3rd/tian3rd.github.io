## Basics

This time, I re-picked up the JavaScript with the help of a [Web dev course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp). The only differences this time around are that I would try to implment the website scripts and integrate them into my blog here. For instance, after today's lessons, I just updated the [Dicee Game](https://tian3rd.github.io/dicee.html) and uploaded it for future review.

```javascript
// what's the difference between a var and const?
var a = "hello, world!";
typeof a;
alert(a);
var b = prompt("Type in your name: ");

// document selector; .innerHTML .textContent
// getElementsByTagName("") getElementById("") getElementsByClassName("")
document.querySelector("someSelector").innerHTML =
  "<strong>hello, world</strong>";
// select a link inside a list ID and set the color to red
document.querySelector("#list a").style.color = "red";
// set the btn class background to transparent, beware of hyphen to camel case, refer to the above link
document.querySelector(".btn").style.backgroundColor = "transparent";
// add a .invisible class in related css file, and use js to toggle it
document.querySelector("a").classList.add("invisible");
document.querySelector("a").classList.toggle("invisible");

// attribute getter and setter
titleLink = document.querySelector("h1").getAttribute("href");
newTitleLink = document
  .querySelector("h1")
  .setAttribute("href", "www.example.com");

// set background to transparent
// background-color: transparent;
// or set visibility to hidden
```

```html
<!-- use script to insert js file before the end of `body` closing tag-->
<script src=""></script>
```

## Problems along the way

- If I just put `dicee.html` (instead of creating `dicee.md` and use the front matter in Jekyll) under the root folder, it will not be rendered. So the tentative solution now is that I put `dicee.html` in `_include` folder and use `dicee.md` to include it.

- Another tricky one is the setting of `css` properties. How to center and how to position and scale, this is a serious problem which potentially will cost me time and pain. For this, I need to review some basics with `css`, starting with <1linelayouts.glitch.me> which gives a brief introduction to 10 useful `css` layout tricks which gives a brief introduction to 10 useful `css` layout tricks.
