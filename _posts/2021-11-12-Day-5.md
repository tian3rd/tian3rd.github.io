## More

OK, the exam is over. But it kept a few waiting without any response in the Zoom when the exam started. The reason is that it had trouble allocating all students to corresponding breakout rooms. I was one of the less than 20 students who waited there without any headsup. When I was finally got into the breakout room, the invigilator forgot to check my ID and brief me about the rules. So when it actually started, I didn't know where to download the exam paper. There went first 4 minutes out of 120 minutes when I waited for the response. The thing is that the paper was not under "Final Exam" section. What a genius!

## One More Thing

The Techlaucher team was quite a thing. One word: plastic.

Done talking about them. Not worth it.
