## What is your career ambition?

> work to become, not to acquire. --[Elbert Hubbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbert_Hubbard)

If I look myself in the mirror and ask the question: _what is your career ambition_, I would probably get a confused emojiðŸ¤¨ as an answer. But after several hoursâ€™ pondering, I might have a clue.

You see, first of all, as an international student who seeks to land a job in the capital city, itâ€™s considered a luxury to talk about career ambitions when getting any ICT related job is already a boss level challenge. However, for the sake of this workshop topic, letâ€™s assume thatâ€™s no biggie for me. Ideally, I want a career thatâ€™ll help me grow as a software engineer to help meet the challenges society is facing today, such as global warming issues. Also, I value technology skills and practical actions above all other factors, because the world is already filled with so many prattlers. In conclusion, my career ambition is finding a way to constantly improve myself while also contributing to solving the real problems in society.
