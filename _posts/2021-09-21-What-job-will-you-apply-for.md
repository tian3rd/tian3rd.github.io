> "You can only become truly accomplished at something you love. Don't make money your goal. Instead pursue the things you love doing and then do them so well that people can't take their eyes off of you." - [Maya Angelou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Angelou)

When it comes to finding a job that's suitable for me right now, the first thing that comes into my mind is the area of front-end designer. I used to spend a lot of time exploring and implementing different algorithms in a project, never paying too much attention to the design part. As I get to know more about design, I find it more satisfying to apply what I have learnt into a graphical user interface such as the website or an application. It would also be good start as my first job after graduation.

After doing some search on [seek](https://www.seek.com.au/), I find [this front end developer](https://www.seek.com.au/job/53994928?type=standout#searchRequestToken=97b3677a-d88d-4047-8b53-c2eab1c0aa19) position is applicable for me. The team is a young and diverse one with enthusiasm for techinical challenges and quality code. I have equipped myself with relevant front-end knowledge such as `React.js`, `CSS` and `RESTful` web services which would definitely help contribute to the team project. On the other hand, as a front end developer, I can also get hands-on experience by actively involving myself in all phases of the project, including sprint planning, prototype designing and interface implementation. I hope this job would become a fun and rewarding experience.
