> Never let your memories be greater than your dreams. [Doug Ivester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Ivester)

Off a smooth start but got lazy in the later half of this week. Need to work on the web development with integration of hosting and frameworks. In the meanwhile, just focus on the curriculums of school, and pick up the fundamentals little by little in my free time.

It's a long way between knowing the name of something and knowing something. Same applies to the resources you get: without understanding it, it's just a name.

My grandma passed away this Thursday. Memories flash by and I miss her so much. Pictures of the big family gathering pop up on my phone screen, and I'm flooded with sorrowness. The music I'm listening is just as sad.

The best way to honor my grandma is to remember her in the heart, and write those memories down. Maybe I'll do a little interview with my mom each with to get the pieces together.
