## Soundtracks

1. [卧虎藏龙原声带 Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - Orignal Motion Picture Soundtrack](https://music.apple.com/us/album/crouching-tiger-hidden-dragon-original-motion-picture/1035012026)

This masterpiece album brought by Tan Dun, Yo-yo Ma and Shanghai National Orchestra is so amazing that the first few seconds of the first piece has already given me goosebumps. Even as an amateur, I can relive some clips of the movie with the guidance of the doleful melody. Different instruments interweave and reverberate across the album, with each playing its part to bring out delicate yet touching emotions. The theme song performed by Coco is also breaking my heart. Coco is stunning at both the orignal Chinese song and the English version. By the way, the names of the songs are also great translations from Chinese which I can't help but share them here:

1. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon 卧虎藏龙
2. The Eternal Vow 永恒的誓约
3. A Wedding Interrupted 闹婚
4. Night Fight 夜门

## Performance

1. [2 set violin channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a315S3_JtZ8)

This channel brings some light entertainment in the music world from two funny guys who actually are great violin players. When I'm feeling tired, I'd sometime switch to this channel to enjoy the critics of music perfomances from these two. The above link is one that I like the most. It's really enlightning to test the limit of human performances.
