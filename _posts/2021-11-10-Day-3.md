> You measure the size of the accomplishment by the obstacles that you had to overcome to reach your goals. - [Booker T. Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booker_T._Washington)

## Overview

Today's task is to understand the graphs and graph algorithms. Also, it's time to do some exercises. Besides, let's build a snake game!
